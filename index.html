      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The information in the head element is called metadata and, aside from the title of the webpage, is not visible to the user.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Visible content within the body element includes text, images, hyperlinks, and paragraphing.</li>
        <li>If a webpage is a house, HTML is the framework that provides structure.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>We can apply CSS properties by referencing HTML elements such as header, footer, and h1; however we can also add styles to custom class selectors and assigning the attributes to certain elements.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add [file]: add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage).</li>
          <li>git add -A: Adding all changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert description": Commit all changes to repository, make sure to add a description for referencing.</li>
          <li>git restore: unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory. Used to be called git reset.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Makes sure current branch is up to date before opening a PR.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-css: Push up all changes in directory. feature/add-css is just an example.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>To randomize a selection, use a special Math function Math.floor(Math.random() * topics.length)];</li>
          <li>Array indices always start at zero.</li>
          <li>For loops contain three statements: declare a variable and give it the starting point for our loop, condition that will keep the loop running (ie, x less than var.length), and iteration rate (ie x+1) </li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. You must call a function by name to execute.</li>
